# Safeway-Frontend

## Deployment

Few commands are required to run in order to build:

```
npm install && npm run build
```

After that you can find static files in `dist` directory. Move them where you want or run http server from that directory.

## Node and NPM versions

During the developement process we were using `node v10.13.0` and `NPM v6.4.1` and it was working fine. It is set in `package.json` and in `.nvmrc`.

Enjoy!
